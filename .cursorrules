**Wasm Hash**: `6938f04aa6e798ab6a03b1ba6e872b0e00ca52b8ee39c8b746e5a74ab2eadea3`

### Core Functions Implemented & Tested:

#### **Write Functions:**

```typescript
initialize(admin: Address, usdc_token: Address, blend_pool: Address,
          yield_rate: u32, round_duration: u64, min_deposit: i128) -> void
```

- Initializes lottery pool with Blend integration
- Sets pool parameters and starts first round

```typescript
enter_lottery(player: Address, amount: i128) -> void
```

- ✅ Transfers USDC from player to lottery contract
- ✅ Authorizes Blend pool for token transfers
- ✅ Deposits USDC to Blend as SupplyCollateral (request_type: 2)
- ✅ Tracks player entry and updates round stats
- ✅ **FULLY TESTED - ALL 3 PLAYERS SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED**

```typescript
pick_winner() -> Address
```

- ✅ Withdraws USDC from Blend (WithdrawCollateral, request_type: 3)
- ✅ Calculates yield: `(balance_after - deposits) / 20` (5% of available)
- ✅ Randomly selects winner using `ledger.timestamp() ^ ledger.sequence()`
- ✅ Pays winner: original_deposit + yield
- ✅ Handles jackpot rollover if <3 players
- ✅ **TESTED - WINNER SELECTED, 5 USDC YIELD DISTRIBUTED**

```typescript
claim_refund(player: Address, round_id: u32) -> void
```

- ✅ Allows non-winners to claim full refund
- ✅ Prevents double-claiming
- ✅ Prevents winner from claiming refund
- ✅ **TESTED - BOTH LOSERS GOT FULL REFUNDS**

## 🔧 CRITICAL TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Blend Integration Pattern (WORKING):

**Deposit Flow:**

```rust
// 1. Authorize token transfer (CRITICAL!)
env.authorize_as_current_contract(vec![
    &env,
    InvokerContractAuthEntry::Contract(SubContractInvocation {
        context: ContractContext {
            contract: usdc_token,
            fn_name: Symbol::new(&env, "transfer"),
            args: (lottery_contract, blend_pool, amount).into_val(&env),
        },
        sub_invocations: vec![&env],
    }),
]);

// 2. Call Blend submit with SupplyCollateral
Request {
    request_type: 2,  // SupplyCollateral (earns yield)
    address: usdc_token,
    amount: amount,
}
```

**Withdrawal Flow:**

```rust
// 1. Authorize (same pattern)
// 2. Call Blend submit with WithdrawCollateral
Request {
    request_type: 3,  // WithdrawCollateral
    address: usdc_token,
    amount: total_deposits,
}
```

### Yield Calculation (TESTED & WORKING):

```rust
let balance_after = check_balance();
let available_for_yield = balance_after - round.total_deposits;
let total_yield = available_for_yield / 20;  // 5% of available
```

**Why This Works:**

- `balance_after` = house_money + blend_withdrawals
- `round.total_deposits` = what we need to refund to losers
- `available_for_yield` = leftover (house money + any real Blend yield)
- Taking 5% ensures house money lasts 20+ rounds

### Stroops Conversion (CRITICAL):

```typescript
1 USDC = 10,000,000 stroops
```

**Always multiply by 10^7 when sending amounts to contracts!**

## 🧪 TEST RESULTS (Full Round Validation)

**Test Script**: `./scripts/test_full_round.sh`  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED (All 8 phases successful)

### Proven Capabilities:

✅ **Phase 1-2**: Player entries (15 + 20 + 12 USDC)  
✅ **Phase 3**: Blend deposits successful (funds in Blend earning yield)  
✅ **Phase 4**: Round duration timer (2 minutes)  
✅ **Phase 5**: Winner selection (Player2 won 5 USDC yield!)  
✅ **Phase 6**: Refund mechanism (Player1 & Player3 got 100% back)  
✅ **Phase 7**: Balance verification (no-loss proven)  
✅ **Phase 8**: Global stats tracking

### Actual Test Results:

```
Initial Balances:
  Player1: 1455 USDC
  Player2: 4440 USDC
  Player3: 2964 USDC
  Contract: 10 USDC (house money)

After Round 1:
  Player1: 1455 USDC (±0) - Full refund ✅
  Player2: 4445 USDC (+5) - WON! Got 20 deposit + 5 yield ✅
  Player3: 2964 USDC (±0) - Full refund ✅
  Contract: 5 USDC (house money remaining)

Round 1 Stats:
  Total deposits: 47 USDC
  Total yield paid: 5 USDC
  Winner: Player2 (GDH6N...)
  No-loss verified: ✅
```

## 🎨 FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

### Tech Stack (ALREADY SET UP):

- ✅ Next.js 16.0.0 (App Router)
- ✅ TypeScript 5
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 4
- ✅ @stellar/stellar-sdk 14.3.0
- ✅ React 19.2.0

**Location**: `/ui` directory

### What Frontend Needs to Build:

#### **1. Stellar Integration Layer** (`lib/stellar.ts`)

```typescript
// Constants
const STROOPS = 10_000_000;
const TESTNET_RPC = "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org";
const NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = "Test SDF Network ; September 2015";

// Functions needed:
- connectFreighter() -> string  // Returns publicKey
- buildTransaction() -> Transaction
- submitTransaction() -> Result
- parseContractResult() -> any
```

#### **2. Contract Interaction** (`lib/contracts.ts`)

```typescript
// Read functions:
- getCurrentRound(poolId: string) -> Round
- getPlayers(poolId: string, roundId: number) -> Address[]
- getStats(poolId: string) -> GlobalStats

// Write functions:
- approveUSDC(from: string, spender: string, amount: number) -> void
- enterLottery(poolId: string, player: string, amount: number) -> void
- claimRefund(poolId: string, player: string, roundId: number) -> void
```

#### **3. UI Components Needed:**

**Essential:**

- `WalletConnect.tsx` - Freighter wallet integration
- `PoolCard.tsx` - Display pool info (deposits, players, timer)
- `EnterLottery.tsx` - Amount input + approve + enter flow
- `PlayerList.tsx` - Show entered players with ghost names
- `CountdownTimer.tsx` - Round end countdown

**Nice-to-Have:**

- `WinnerDisplay.tsx` - Winner announcement animation
- `GhostNameGen.tsx` - Convert addresses to spooky names
- `AchievementBadges.tsx` - Player achievements
- `StatsDisplay.tsx` - Global stats visualization

#### **4. Ghost Name Generator:**

```typescript
function getGhostName(address: string): string {
  const prefixes = ["Spooky", "Haunted", "Phantom", "Cursed", "Shadow", "Dark"];
  const names = [
    "Vampire",
    "Banshee",
    "Wraith",
    "Poltergeist",
    "Ghoul",
    "Specter",
  ];
  const seed = parseInt(address.slice(-8), 16);
  return `${prefixes[seed % 6]} ${names[(seed >> 4) % 6]}`;
}
```

## 🎨 HALLOWEEN THEME (Recommended)

### Color Palette:

```css
--halloween-orange: #ff6b35;
--halloween-purple: #8b5cf6;
--halloween-black: #1a1a1a;
--halloween-green: #10b981;
--spooky-glow: #ff9500;
```

### Design Elements:

- Pool cards styled as bubbling cauldrons
- Countdown timer with pulsing glow
- Dark gradient background
- Ghost names for all players
- Winner announcement with animation

---

## 🚨 KEY LEARNINGS & GOTCHAS

### 1. **Blend Integration Requires Authorization**

```rust
// MUST authorize before calling Blend's submit()
env.authorize_as_current_contract(vec![...]);
```

**Why**: Blend calls `token.transfer()` on behalf of your contract, which requires pre-authorization.

### 2. **Request Types Matter**

- Type **2** = SupplyCollateral (earns yield) ✅
- Type **3** = WithdrawCollateral (gets money back) ✅
- NOT type 0/1 (those don't earn yield)

### 3. **Yield in Short Timeframes**

- 2 minutes on Blend = basically zero real yield
- **Solution**: House money (50-500 USDC per pool) provides sustainable demo yields
- 5% yield per round = ~20 rounds before house money depletes

### 4. **Stroops Conversion**

- **ALWAYS** multiply USDC by 10,000,000 for contract calls
- Contract returns i128 as strings (use BigInt in frontend)

### 5. **Freighter Wallet**

```typescript
// Check installation
window.freighter !== undefined;

// Get public key
await window.freighter.getPublicKey();

// Sign transaction
await window.freighter.signTransaction(txXDR);
```

**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours for full frontend implementation

---

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES FOR FRONTEND DEV

1. **Contract calls are async** - always use await
2. **i128 values** come as strings - parse carefully
3. **Freighter signing** required for ALL write operations (approve + enter)
4. **Error handling** - Stellar errors need parsing for user-friendly messages
5. **Countdown timer** - Use `round.end_time` (Unix timestamp in seconds)
6. **Ghost names** - Generate client-side from address hash
7. **Mobile first** - Judges might view on phones

---

## 🚀 QUICK START FOR FRONTEND

```bash
# Navigate to UI directory
cd /Users/shivanshsingh/stellarlotto/ui

# Install any missing dependencies
npm install

# Create .env.local file (copy values from root .env)
cp ../.env .env.local

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```
